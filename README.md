# Spring-hibernate

- Bean is an object
- IOC with XML config - when object is created, no need to be hard-coded
- DI with XML config - imagine you order a car (object) that is produced by a car factory (Bean factory) and put parts together 

- Bean scope - singleton (by default), prototype
- Bean LifeCycle - Container created -> bean instantiated -> custom init -> bean used -> container destroyed -> custom destroy
